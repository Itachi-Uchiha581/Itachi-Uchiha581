## Building until AGI replaces me 🏗️

> Building <a href="https://peneterrer.com/">Peneterrer</a> to replace Pentesters

Cool projects that I've built in the past:
- GAN based ETF price simulator
- HERC Portfolio optimization using EVaR
- Monocular depth estimation-based image classification (Image classifier built on depth estimated images)
- Built Auto Data in early 2024 to generate datasets for fine-tuning (distillation for fine tuning of smaller LLMs)
- Auto trading using LLMs, ASL translator, Lane detection through image segmentation, Brain tumor object detection, Human detection through Yolo v5 + 8 others

**Hate LLM Orch frameworks**   
**Love automating things that shouldn't be automated**
